## Operational
- Use provided npm scripts. For Prisma, prefer `prisma:migrate`, `prisma:deploy`, `prisma:generate`.

## Prisma Migrations - CRITICAL RULE
- **NEVER modify migration files after they are created and applied to the database**
- Migration files in `prisma/migrations/**/*.sql` and `prisma/migrations/migration_lock.toml` are IMMUTABLE once applied
- **NEVER format, prettify, or auto-fix migration files** - they are excluded from Prettier, ESLint, and other formatters
- If you need to fix something, create a NEW migration instead
- Changing migrations after application causes checksum mismatches and breaks the migration system
- If migrations were accidentally modified, you must:
  1. Revert the changes in Git
  2. Or create a new migration to fix the issue
  3. Never manually edit applied migrations
- Always review migration files before committing - ensure they haven't been auto-formatted
